# churn-analysis-PowerBi


## Project Overview
This project presents a case study on customer churn analysis for a fictional telecom company, Databel.

Using Power BI, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer data from a specific time period to uncover behavioral trends and service usage patterns.

The key goals of the project were to:

investigate churn patterns  

- identify key contributing factors

- visualize insights through an interactive dashboard that supports strategic decision-making

## Key Insights Delivered:

- Contract Type Impact: Customers with month-to-month contracts had the highest churn rate, with nearly 50% leaving the service — a clear indicator of instability in short-term subscriptions.

- Age & Plan Sensitivity: Among customers with no group plan, churn began to significantly increase after the age of 50, suggesting age-related dissatisfaction or changing needs.

- High Churn Combo: Customers on month-to-month contracts who pay via direct debit churned the most — with a rate of 53.9% and averaging 1.47 support calls per customer, highlighting a potential issue in the billing or payment experience. Interestingly, this trend is less severe among one-year contracts.

- Data Plan Opportunity: Customers without unlimited plans who consume more than 10GB of data are being charged significantly — suggesting an upsell opportunity. Targeting these customers with unlimited plan offers may increase satisfaction and retention.


## Tools & Skills Used:
- Power BI (Data modeling, DAX, Power Query)
