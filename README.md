# Churn Analysis In PowerBi


## Project Overview
This project presents a case study on customer churn analysis for a fictional telecom company, Databel.

Using Power BI, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer data from a specific time period to uncover behavioral trends and service usage patterns.

The key goals of the project were to:

investigate churn patterns  

- identify key contributing factors

- visualize insights through an interactive dashboard that supports strategic decision-making

## Power BI Report Structure:
- Overview Page
Provides a high-level summary of customer churn across the company. Includes overall churn rate, total customers vs. churned customers, churn trends over time, and top churn reasons. This page is designed to give decision-makers a snapshot of the problem.

- Age Groups Page
Focuses on how churn behavior varies by age. This page explores the relationship between customer age, plan types, and churn likelihood.

- Service and Payment Page
Analyzes churn based on service plans, payment methods, and subscription types. It highlights combinations of services that lead to higher churn and opportunities for retention improvement.

## Key Insights Delivered:

- Contract Type Impact: Customers with month-to-month contracts had the highest churn rate, with nearly 50% leaving the service — a clear indicator of instability in short-term subscriptions.

- Age & Plan Sensitivity: Among customers with no group plan, churn began to significantly increase after the age of 50, suggesting age-related dissatisfaction or changing needs.

- High Churn Combo: Customers on month-to-month contracts who pay via direct debit churned the most — with a rate of 53.9% and averaging 1.47 support calls per customer, highlighting a potential issue in the billing or payment experience. Interestingly, this trend is less severe among one-year contracts.

- Data Plan Opportunity: Customers without unlimited plans who consume more than 10GB of data are being charged significantly — suggesting an upsell opportunity. Targeting these customers with unlimited plan offers may increase satisfaction and retention.

- Geographic Insight: The majority of churned customers are located in California (CA), highlighting a potential regional issue or competitive pressure that warrants further investigation.
